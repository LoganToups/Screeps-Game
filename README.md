# Screeps-Game
All my Screeps code in one place

Be warned, I write Java the way a monkey types on a keyboard.

*Stable branch: As it says, the stable version of my code that is "mostly" free from bugs, and should just work plug and play style.

*Experimental branch: Prone to breaking, this branch is where I try out new implementations or experiment with refactoring, usually doesn't always work and I fall back
  to the stable branch more often than not.
  
 *Composite branch: I wouldn't worry about this. Just a lot of refrence code.
 
 
 Using screeps with an IDE and GIT:
 1. Once screeps is downloaded and played for the first time, you will have a file path that looks something like 
    C:\Users\Logan\AppData\Local\Screeps\scripts\screeps.com\default, boot up your IDE of choice, open new file, and navigate here, and that should open all the 
    .js files for you to work on, any files edited and then saved here will be automatically pushed to the screeps server by the client.
    it is recommended that if you create a new module, you should do it in the client, and then open the new file in the IDE to work on.
    
2. With that out of the way, you can clone a GIT repository, I usually save the copy outside the default folder in ../screeps.com/, you can copy and paste the files inside the repo clone to your default folder, open the default folder in your IDE, and there you go. It's crude, but effective.
